# Early Brain Stroke Prediction by Machine Learning
Early Brain Stroke Prediction by Machine Learning: This project uses machine learning to predict early brain stroke risk based on health and lifestyle factors like age, hypertension, heart disease, and glucose levels. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis by building predictive models and evaluating their performance.
